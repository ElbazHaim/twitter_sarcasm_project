    "# Twitter Sarcasm & Irony Detection Project\n",
    "### By Asaf Levi & Haim Elbaz \n",
    "In this project, we will build several machine learning models model to detect sarcasm and irony in tweets, and compare their performance between models and preprocessing levels. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using the scikit-learn library for building our classifiers, with NLTK for natural language processing tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using a labeled dataset of tweets, built as part of the research presented in the paper \"Quantitative Analysis of the Differences between Sarcasm and Irony (Klinger and Litvak, 2016)\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains data labeled as \"regular\", \"sarcasm\", \"irony\" and \"figurative\", as tagged by the tweet's writer. For our purposes, we will unite sarcasm and irony into a single category, omitting \"figurative\". \n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps Involved\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Cleaning: We will clean and preprocess the tweet data by removing emojis, URLs, usernames, etc., handling necessary text transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Feature Extraction: We will extract relevant features from the preprocessed tweets, such as bag-of-words, TF-IDF representations, and sentiment analysis.  These features will be used as input to our machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Model Training: We will use scikit-learn's machine learning algorithms - Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine Classifier and Random Forest Classifier  to train sarcasm-irony detection models on the labeled dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Model Evaluation: We will evaluate the performance of our models with the help of a designated test dataset that will go through the same processing steps described. We will evaluate the models' performance using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Prediction: Once our model is trained and evaluated, we can use it to predict sarcasm and irony in new, unseen tweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep our notebook organized, we will store custom functions in a separate `helpers.py` file. This file will contain functions for data preprocessing, feature extraction, and any other utility functions we may need throughout the project. We will import these functions as needed in our notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started with importing the necessary libraries and loading the dataset!"

TF-IDF takes into account the importance of the word within its tweet, which seems to be quite important when it comes to tweets, in particular in large dataset, as seen in \"Sentiment Analysis on COVID Tweets: An Experimental Analysis on the Impact of Count Vectorizer and TF-IDF on Sentiment Predictions using Deep Learning Models (Raza et al., 2021)\""
